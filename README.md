# Sentiment Analysis Notebook

This repository features a notebook dedicated to sentiment analysis across various categories, including Normal, Anxiety, Depression, Personality Disorder, Bipolar Disorder, Stress, and Suicidal Thoughts. Utilizing BERT followed by GRU, I developed a model to predict emotional states based on input sentences.

To enhance the model's performance, I implemented data cleaning and balancing techniques, addressing the initial class imbalance in the dataset. As a result, the model achieved an accuracy of 0.78.

Feel free to explore the notebook for detailed insights and methodologies!
